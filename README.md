# Anku-Project

Welcome to the Anku-Project repository! This repository contains two projects: SLR-Parsing-Project and VendingMachine.

## SLR-Parsing-Project

SLR-Parsing-Project is a compiler designed to perform SLR parsing, which determines whether a given input adheres to a specific structure. The code utilizes a dictionary that represents the properties of a table, and it checks for key compatibility within the dictionary. If the input is inconsistent with the table transformations, it means that the input is not present in the dictionary, resulting in an error message displayed using the try-except construct. On the other hand, if the input is formatted according to the table structures, it is considered a valid input. The project is implemented in Python.

  - This is a Word document version of the project, providing additional information and documentation.

## VendingMachine

VendingMachine is a project that simulates a simple vending machine. The state of the vending machine is stored in the data structure `list1`, which holds the necessary information. The project follows a specific algorithm, and all the steps are explained to guide the user. By following these steps, the user should be able to operate the vending machine without any issues.
